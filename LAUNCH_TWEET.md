Claude Code has 115k developers. Multiple marketplaces exist, but none validate quality.

Developers waste hours testing agents that:

- Produce inconsistent results

We fixed that.

Claude Agents Pro includes:

✅ Automated quality scoring (scripts/quality-scorer.py)

✅ 34 production-ready agents

Quality first, always.
```

### Tweet 4 (Pricing)

## Reddit Post (r/ClaudeAI)

**Title**: Launching Claude Agents Pro - First premium marketplace with quality validation ($12/mo, 15 agents free)

**Body**:
```markdown
Hey r/ClaudeAI!

I'm launching **Claude Agents Pro** - the first premium Claude Code marketplace with automated quality validation.

## The Problem
Claude Code has 115k developers now, and multiple agent marketplaces exist, but **none validate quality**. I've wasted too many hours testing broken agents with:
- Wrong tool configurations
- Broken prompts
- No error handling
- Inconsistent outputs

## The Solution
Built a quality framework that scores every agent (70+ minimum, 85+ for production). Created 34 production-ready agents organized in tiers:

**Free (15 agents - forever):**
- Meta orchestration: `agent-coordinator`
- Foundation engineering: API design, testing, code review, debugging, DDD, system design, performance
- Development: Frontend, mobile, Python, TypeScript specialists
- Infrastructure: Backend, full-stack, data pipelines

**Pro ($12/month - 23 total agents):**
- Cloud architecture (AWS specialist)
- Database design and performance
- DevOps automation + observability
- SRE incident response
- Security architecture
- Research & technical documentation

**Enterprise ($45/month - all 34 agents):**
- Machine learning engineer
- Complete trading suite (9 agents): algorithmic trading, quant analysis, backtesting, risk management, portfolio optimization, fundamental analysis, market data, ML for trading, compliance

## Technical Details
- Simple license validation (local file, zero tracking)
- One-command installation
- Apache 2.0 for free agents
- 30-day money-back guarantee

## Why Premium?
Maintaining quality validation takes time and resources. Priced between GitHub Copilot ($10) and Cursor ($20). Free tier is generous - 15 production-ready agents covering most use cases.

## Get Started
- **Repo**: https://github.com/ubehera/claude-agents-pro
- **Pro License**: https://gumroad.com/l/claude-agents-pro
- **Enterprise**: https://gumroad.com/l/claude-agents-enterprise

**Early bird**: First 50 Pro users get $8/month (33% off)

Happy to answer questions!

## Hacker News Post

**Title**: Claude Agents Pro – First premium Claude Code marketplace with quality validation

**URL**: https://github.com/ubehera/claude-agents-pro

**Text** (if Ask HN):
```markdown
Hi HN,

I built Claude Agents Pro - the first premium marketplace for Claude Code agents with automated quality validation.

Background: Claude Code launched earlier this year and now has 115k developers. Several free marketplaces exist (80+ agents in some), but none validate quality. I spent too much time testing broken agents.

Solution: Created a quality scoring framework (automated rubric) that requires 70+ for all agents (85+ for production). Built 34 production-ready agents in tiered architecture.

Pricing:
- Free: 15 core agents (orchestration, foundation engineering, development)
- Pro: $12/month for 23 agents (+ cloud, security, DevOps, SRE, observability)
- Enterprise: $45/month for all 34 (+ ML and complete trading/finance suite)

Why premium? Quality validation requires ongoing maintenance. Priced between GitHub Copilot ($10) and Cursor ($20). Free tier covers most use cases.

Technical details:
- Simple local license validation (no tracking)
- One-command installation via shell script
- Apache 2.0 for free agents, dual license for premium
- Automated testing framework included

Looking for feedback on:
1. Pricing model - is $12/mo reasonable for validated agents?
2. License validation approach - too simple? Should I use server-side?
3. Free tier generosity - 15 agents (44% of total) good enough?

Repo: https://github.com/ubehera/claude-agents-pro

Would love to hear your thoughts!

🚀 Launching Claude Agents Pro - Quality-Validated AI Agents for Developers

After seeing Claude Code grow to 115,000 developers, I noticed a critical gap: no marketplace validates agent quality.

So I built one.

✅ 34 production-ready agents
✅ Automated quality scoring (70+ minimum)
✅ Tiered architecture for easy discovery
✅ 15 agents free forever

Pro tier: $12/month
Enterprise: $45/month

Early adopters get 33% off.

What I learned building this:
1. Developers need quality guarantees, not just volume
2. Premium can work in open source if you deliver value
3. Pricing between GitHub Copilot ($10) and Cursor ($20) feels right
